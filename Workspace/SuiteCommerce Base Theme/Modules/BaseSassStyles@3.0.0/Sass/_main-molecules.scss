// Molecules
//
// Molecules are the smallest fundamental units of compound made up of two or more atoms held together to form a simple piece of functionality.
// They are simple combinations built to reuse, but not necessarily have meaning on their own without further context.
// Molecules often serve as the backbone for a more complex system.
