### Structure

This syleguide has been divided into 3 main sections:

*  Styles
*  Atoms
*  Molecules

Within each of them you´ll find several definitions and, whenever needed, you´ll also find a way in which to copy the markup and paste it right into your **`code`** with no aditional changes to be done. You can see the markup by clicking on the "Show markup" link beneath each component.

In those rare cases in which you need to execute javascript for the component to work in the expected way, you will also find the necessary **`code`** documented.

---

### SASS

This styleguide works directly with the **`sass`** files of your distro. Therefore, whenever you make changes yo the local **`sass`** files, you will be making changes to the styleguide.

The styleguide will help you preview all the components affected by your changes without the need of reviewing the whole site.

> **Note:** For the changes to be rendered you will need to run: **`gulp local styleguide`** on your terminal command line.
